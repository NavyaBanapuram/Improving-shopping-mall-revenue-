With the rise of big data and deep learning, AI-driven marketing has become increasingly importantâ€”especially in online commerce. Digital coupons, a key promotional tool, are now being personalized to improve customer retention, which is far more cost-effective than acquiring new users.

This project focuses on real-time, AI-powered customized coupon issuance using deep learning and customer clickstream data. We segment users, predict churn, and issue personalized coupons, resulting in increased conversion rates and reduced churn. Unlike traditional approaches, our system adapts to real-time behavioral data and has been successfully applied in a live online shopping mall.
